Openbox is a minimalistic, highly configurable, next generation window manager
with extensive standards support.

**Openbox is not Blackbox**. Openbox is not related to Blackbox
in any way except for its visual appearance.

Openbox originated as a fork of the Blackbox window manager at a time
when a number of window managers forked off of Blackbox, such as Waimea
and Fluxbox. Starting with Openbox version 3.0, however, Openbox has
branched off to become its own style of window manager. The code was
written entirely from scratch and bears no resemblance or relation to
Blackbox any more.

Openbox aims to be extremely standards compliant, following the ICCCM
standard strictly, as well as throughly implementing support for the
freedesktop.org window manager specification (EWMH). Through these ends,
Openbox is fully capable of being run under both the GNOME and KDE
environments, and supports any and all applications which follow the
same standards.

Openbox is open source software, distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License. See the README and COPYING files in the
distribution for further details.

Most distributions of Linux include Openbox, see
