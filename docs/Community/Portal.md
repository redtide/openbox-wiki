## Mailing List

The Openbox mailing list is a great place to go to ask questions about
Openbox, and any help you can provide to others is always very
appreciated. Please use the [bugzilla](../Contribute.md)
for bug reports and patches as they get lost very easily on mailing
lists.

You can **subscribe** to and **unsubscribe** from the mailing list at
[this webpage](https://icculus.org/mailman/listinfo/openbox).

To **post to the mailing list**, send the email to
<openbox@icculus.org>. (You need to subscribe before you can post.)

Archives of the mailing list can be
[found here (mailman)](https://icculus.org/pipermail/openbox/) or
[here (gmane)](http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.openbox).

## IRC

Openbox has an IRC channel on [oftc](http://www.oftc.net/) stealthily
called [#openbox](irc://irc.oftc.net/#openbox).

For support, please [read the documentation](../Help/Contents.md)
and [use the mailing list](#mailing-list).
