# Write access request

**Please read below to get write access!**

Due to excessive spamming of the wiki, we've had to resort to turning off
global write access. But we really do **want you to contribute** to the wiki.

All you need to do is verify that you are indeed a person.

1. Send an email to [the openbox mailing list](../Community/Portal.md) to request access.
2. Include your wiki username in the email.
3. Maybe say hello and prove you are, indeed, a person. :)
