# Suspend and hibernate

Although suspend is not given as an option on the logout menu, it can be done.
At the command line, enter:

```bash
pm-suspend
```

(This works in systems including Mandriva, Arch Linux and Debian-based systems -
is it a universal Linux command?)

## Adding suspend and hibernate buttons at logout

A new package has been created as an alternative to the current
openbox-logout script. It is a script which adds additional buttons for
"Hibernate" and "Suspend" at logout. It may give mixed results with
actually using these features. See
