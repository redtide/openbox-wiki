# Starting Openbox with KDE

![LoginOptions.png][1] To log into the K Desktop Environment with Openbox
as your window manager, select the `KDE/Openbox` option when logging in through KDM,
which you can see in Figure [1].

If you don't use a graphical log in, you can use the
`openbox-kde-session` command to start a KDE session with Openbox
as your window manager.

See the [getting started guide][3] for more details.
